# WicHacks
The goal of the "Slaydies" WicHack group is to make an inclusive Period and Medication Tracker for people with uteruses/periods all over the world. It is meant to be gender minority focused, so that everyone feels comfortable using the application.

By 24 hours, we aim to have completed a rough version of an Android application in Kotlin with base functionality or the look we are going for, so that going forward it will be easier to implement the rest of the app.

## Main Functionality:
 * Period Tracking
 * Medication Tracking
 * Symptom Logging
 * Water Tracking
 * Feedback System
 
As well as this, we have a small website idea for the application that guides users to download the app or email for feedback. 

We hope you enjoy!
